I have loaded the input csv file into a Pandas DataFrame. 
After defining the transform_data function, I have extracted the employee information, compensation data, review data, and engagement data. 
I have determined the effective dates and end dates for each record. Created rows for each period with consistent data. 
Defined a function to get dates in between two dates. 
Calculated End Date. Then added the columns to the output file. 
Transformed the data to a DataFrame. 
Saved the transformed data into a new csv file. 
Finally, I have displayed the transformed data.
